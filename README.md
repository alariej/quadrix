- No data collection whatsoever
- Does not support [E2EE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption)
- No customization (almost), no widgets, no bots, no phone calls
- Integrated video-conferencing with [Jitsi Meet](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/)
- Programmed with [ReactXP](https://github.com/Microsoft/reactxp)
- React Native apps for Android and iOS
- Electron apps for Windows, MacOS, and Linux (amd64, arm64, armhf)
- Web app (unstable, glitchy UI, for testing only) at [app.quadrix.chat](https://app.quadrix.chat)
- Push notifications on mobile devices with Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Unique top-down messaging feed
